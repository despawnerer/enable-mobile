# enable-mobile

Include that script to enable mobile view.

```js
require('enable-mobile');
```

That will insert the following code:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, user-scalable=0"/>
```

Useful for tests, apps, demo.

Ideas for enhancements are welcomed.
